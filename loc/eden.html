			<h3>[CORE]</h3>
			
			<h2>New Eden</h2>
			<p>New Eden is perhaps the most important location in <i>Providence</i>. It is the city state that deploys the Angels and it is the main emerging power within the Resemblance. Located East of the Aven in
				the Eastern sectors of the Old Sadon Administration, New Eden is also the most technologically advanced civilisation in the region, in the middle of an industrial boom. The vast industry takes its toll on
				the citizens however who live in fear of the Angels as much as they rely on them.</p>
			<h3>Politics</h3>
			<p>New Eden, at the time of <i>Lazarus Rises</i>, is ruled by the Knights' Council and a parlimentary government. A joint technocracy and democracy; the Knights have full control over the standing military and
			the New Eden Sanctioners. The Ruling Party has absolute authority over economic matters and transportation, alongside managing the factories in the Industrial Quarter.</p>
			<p>The city-state is politically divided in one axis between expansionists, who wish to further the goals of pre-war Eden (i.e. conquering the Resemblance), and reservists, who believe New Eden should focus on developing their 
			own city. In the other axis are those who support the Knights' Council and those who deny its authority, calling for full democracy in Eden.</p>
