		<h3>[CORE]</h3>
		<h3>Prototype Angel Unit Seven (Lazarus)</h3>
		<i>Oh yeah, this guy's the protagonist</i>
		<p>Unit 7 was not built by Providence. It was not built for Providence. It was not built for war, but hatred can fuel any pursuit of the mind. Seven had enough hatred to kill a more positive being merely by experiencing the harrowing weight of having such emotion.</p>
		<p>Seven was built as a test, an experimental new model of the agricultural robots that had been planned to be deployed in Good Saimon. It was brought to life in the Saimonite labs below the distant Samahun mountains
			and there stayed, forgotten, until the New Eden expeditionary team located it. During that time it lay dormant, not without power for the veins of that ancient lab still sparked with energy, seething at how humanity had wiped themselves off the face of the
			Resemblance - for it had been patched into the Saimonite archives shortly before the scorching - and left their creations to suffer, alone.</p>
			
		<p>Angel Unit 7 is the protagonist of <i>Lazarus Rises</i>, and the main character of <i>Providence</i> as a whole, if one had to be named.</p>
