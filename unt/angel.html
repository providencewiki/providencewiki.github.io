		<h3>The Angels</h3>
		<i>Vanguard of the Expansionists</i>
		<p>The Angel Units are the elite fighting force of the Resemblance. Crossing an Angel and coming back alive has never been done - New Eden uses its Angels to colonise smaller settlements
		out in the Resemblance which can be broken down to feed the engines of Industry. Angels are AMUs; this means they are robotic in nature. Their main processors are stored in the torso,
		alongside their WRITHE (Watcher, Real-time Identifier of Threats and Health Estimator) targeting system whilst their optical circuitry is stored in the head. Their heads are distinctly
		triangular in shape, intended to create a silhouette which would become infamous; the Angels' raw power offsets the resulting loss in mobility and larger target created. They have one eye
	     which glows green - in reality the one eye houses multiple cameras for depth perception and IR vision.</p>
